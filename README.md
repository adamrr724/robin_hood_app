## README for Robinhood Ratings Script

This python script will grab the top 100 most popular stocks at the moment, get their analyst "Buy" rating, sort, and then report the findings. 

To get this set up you'll need to have Python & Pip locally installed. 

Install Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Install PIP: https://pypi.org/project/pip/

You'll need to install the Robin Stocks library:

     pip install robin_stocks

https://robin-stocks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Then you add your robinhood credentials to the rh_recommendations.py script in place of "username" & "password" -- and then run the script!

    python3 rh_recommendations.py
